Question: The company doesnâ€™t have good session management system in place, try to exploit that to find the flag.

The question talked about `session management`, so my first response was to see how the session was managed aka cookie. However there was nothing there, so I went to the local storage. 

If you hit `Ctrl + Shift + I` and go to the `application` tab, then look at your left side you will find something called `Local Storage`. Click on the `Local Storage` and go to the url under it. You will see there are couple of states there (if you don't see this try login in to the website). 

```
admin: "false"
loggedIn: "true"
userName: ""helo""
_persist: "{"version":-1,"rehydrated":true}"
```
You will just need to double click the text and set the admin to true (Chrome). Now reload the page and you will get the flag.
