Question: There are some JavaScript bugs here. My source says it’s some kind of ssx attack or something I don’t remember. Can you help me find a secret hidden information?

The link to the question literally tells you that there is a xxs vunerability, so I just entered 
``` 
<script>alert(1)</script>
``` 
to check if it will work and it worked. However, I did't get any flag. Therefore, I looked at the source of the website, and there I found `var flag=""`, so I assumed the question wanted you to print out the flag.

``` 
<script>alert(flag)</script>
``` 
Then you will get the flag.

Answer: flag{simplest_xxs_attack}
