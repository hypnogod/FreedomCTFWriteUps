Question: There is a flag hidden in our discord server.

Link: https://discord.gg/h3Mkc9Nr4N

I joined the discord server and looked though every single channel. After couple of minutes, I found the flag in the #general Channels. 

Note: I was using a desktop and saw the flag at the  top of my screen. If you are on your phone it might be in the sidebar.
