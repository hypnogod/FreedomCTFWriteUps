Title: Weird Text File

Category: Steganography

Rarity: Common

Question: This does not look like a text file

Hint: N/A

File Name: flag.txt

When you open the file in a text editor, you will notice
that in the start of the file there is a header that says
"ï¿½PNG". Additionally all the text seems gibberish, so
I can assume that this not an .txt file. When I change the
file extension.

```
    mv flag.txt flag.png
```

If you click on the image you will be able to see the flag.

Answer: flag{f1le_f0rmat_painn}
