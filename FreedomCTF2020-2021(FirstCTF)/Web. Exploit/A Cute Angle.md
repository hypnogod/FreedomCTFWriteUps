Question: People at Phalerovia use a special browser called "qute" to hide their information. Can you find that information?

The question and the hint told me to use a special browser called "quteBrowser". So you just make the website think you are using "quteBrowser" by using curl command.

```
curl --user-agent "quteBrowser" "https://quentin.freedomctf.org/"
```

Then you will be able to find the flag.
