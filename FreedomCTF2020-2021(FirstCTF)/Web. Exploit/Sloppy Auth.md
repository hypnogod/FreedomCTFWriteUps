Question: I donâ€™t know what the company is thinking but their authentication is on the client side. Can you figure out a way to login?

The question was talking about "authentication" in [client side](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/client-side-vs-server-side/), so I had to look at it's source. 

You can look at the source of the website using `Ctrl + Shift + I` and by going to the `sources` tab. Then you will just need to look through diffrent forlders and get the flag. For this challange the login method used and the flag was under `js => Login => Login.tsx`.

Answer: flag{d0nt_d0_c1i3nt_s1d3_secur1ty}
