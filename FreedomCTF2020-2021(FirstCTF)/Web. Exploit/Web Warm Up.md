Question: See if you can find some sensitive data

The question asked me to find the sensitive data, so I went through all the links in the sources (`CTRL + U`). After going through couple of links, I was able to find `"/server.png"` in `Style/main.css`. 

If you go to [that url](https://quentin.freedomctf.org/server.png), you will be able to find the flag.

Answer: flag{aW1hZ2VhbmRUM3h0}
