Question: Phalerovia AI is a mysterious robot that reveals secrets, if you ask nicely.

The question said the Phalerovia was an AI, I assumed it was a discord bot. If you look closely at the only bot the in the discord server that was called "Phalerovia", you will find little text that says "&&help". Therefore I typed &&help. The bot listed out couple of commands and I was finally able to figure out how the bot worked.

The bot would take the command "&&flag" and a argument.

```
&&flag <arg>
```

Thus, I tried `&&flag please` and I got the flag.
