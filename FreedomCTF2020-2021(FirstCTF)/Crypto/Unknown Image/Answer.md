![unknown image](./CryptoUnknown.png)

The image shows somekind of cipher or language we are supposed to solve. Using the hint and my knowledge I could conclude that this cipher has somethign to do with "Pokemon". After seaching for a while I found a [website that could be used to decode this](https://www.dcode.fr/pokemon-unown-alphabet).

Answer: flag{unknownsarecommon}
